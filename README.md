<h3>Justification</h3>
In Bertin’s Semiology of Graphics, he includes a section that he titles “GEO O: The representation of movement on the plane,” where he lists and provides a number of cartographic concepts related to achieving motion within a graphic. He introduces the principle types of movement: continuous motion, generation of points, lines or areas, variable speeds, and systems of relations (Bertin and Berg 2010). With just these types, a cartographer can visualize information from many different disciplines, for example - the movement of a person over time, the origin locations of individuals within a certain group, the migration of people over time, the flow and speed of traffic, the flow of weather and currents – the list goes on. Yet, there are very limited tools within popular mapping APIs to create these types of graphic representations.
