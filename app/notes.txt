events:
hold, drag

drag needs a timeout... or maybe there is a map event that is similar to 'update-end' (?)

yes, you can use view.ready === true

path2D object seems good...

can save() and restore() canvas states;

Current, and so far best, way to work with a custom canvas above the map:
 initCanvas.insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', ctx.canvas)


 getting concurrent animations is next. not sure how to add multiple paths to canvas at the same time, 
 can I use the same ctx?
